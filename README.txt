To open the project use any version of Unity after 2021.3.15.f1 (Recommended to use the same version), to examine the scripts of the project this can be done from the Unity Editor and through the filesystem. The Python scripts require 'Matplotlib' library to run can be found here: https://matplotlib.org/. To run the project press start on the Unity Editor and press the game screen UI button 'Start' optionally you can enable continous running by enabling the toggle button in the game screen UI. To stop the simulation either let it run until completion or it can be stopped through just pressing the Unity Editors play button. Parameters can be edited through the Simulation game object however if 'Data Collection' is enabled it will run through the list of Simulation Parameters. Integration testing can be enabled by enabling 'Debug' toggle button within the Simulation game object of inside the Unity editor. 
Data Collection can be enabled by enabling the 'DataCollection' toggle within the Simulation game object. Issue boards are located within GitLab and access should already be given.
